# Company member Api search - Rick and Morti Api

This project is created with React, Typescript and Emotion.

When we start the project we get to a login screen. 

With user "admin" and password "test" is entered.

It consists of two parts:

 - In the first one we have a page to search for company members pulling from the github Api. You type the name of the company and if there are results they are shown as cards. Clicking on any of the members you can see the details of the company member.

- There is also a button that leads to the Rick and Morti section. In this section you can pull the Api to display the characters of the series, you can also filter by name or see the detail of the character by clicking on any of them.
